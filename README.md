## What about objects and the properties of objects?


Again, there are many benchmarks for Q&A. And nowadays, neural networks with a 30 mb size can find answers better than humans.
And with Q&A it's possible to get almost any information about objects (what is the **color** of **object_name**).

So defining the simpliest generator of questions based on json-like object descriptions is the trivial thing. (That's called reading :) )

And we dont need to train transformer with 20 billion parameters to get information about anu objects (in final specification or in design rules).

We can extract any data about objects and states with questions.


## What with rules (functions) and so on?


We have defined primitives (with parameters). 
And text rules (with descriptions of positive and negative examples, where properties of objects are described).

Most funny and "unthinkable" thing is that rules consists of objects, and rules are actually is objects too :).

So we can build a basic abstractions (sizes/forces/etc), rules, based on json, and read all specifications. And make even complex rules (with objects and operators).

Also, we need to add some functions that describe relations between objects (size, positions, and other connections). 
And detect them. Note that we can also describe that in json notation (and generate questions, and get information).

(Note that we can write functions bodies like code that takes objects (he he), or use approximations based on machine learning)

So we can build text-based rules (and functions).

That will work better than traditional aproaches because we have context synonyms and other "syntaxis shugar" inside our Q&A net.

And we can also add changing of objects (counts and types). That is the function too ).
